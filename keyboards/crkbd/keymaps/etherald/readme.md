# Etherald Custom Keymap

A simple custom keymap implementation by [me](https://github.com/sethetherald).

Features include:
    - VIA support.
    - Custom [QMK Pet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgIQRazCAjo&t=0s) implementation.
    - A small art display on the master side, full art display on slave side, changing every 10 seconds.
    
All arts in my keymap are originally created by Hammerbeam for the Nice!View display, I simply modified them to fit into a 128x32 screen for personal use. If Hammerbeam himself has a problem with this, I will remove all art display in this repo.
